### How to integrate

1. If you are a consumer facing project (e.g. NFT collection, wallet, social project), you can embed the service directively to your site as below.

Your users will need to login with their wallet and their very own NFT gallery with their collections will be automatically generated in seconds.
Users may choose to save the auto-layout or alter it freely.
